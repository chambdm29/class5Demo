- Communication skills, the ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms

## Intro

### What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions 

### Why Java?

- It is a stable, proven, in-demand language
- It has a wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for large-scale, multi-tiered, reliable and secure network applications

## Course Overview

This course is a kick-start to learning web development, it is immersive and pragmatic. We learn by doing, and focus on understanding the principles of programming practice. Most of the class time will consist of lectures, assignments and projects.

## Healthy Habits

- Commit and push every day to get your progress recorded on GitHub to show potential employers you're active.
- Ask for help if you've been stuck for 10 minutes, or if you don't understand a topic. Ask a neighbor, ask a TA, or ask an instructor.
- Ergonomics
  - good posture, reduce screen brightness and add a blue light filter
- When faced with a new problem:
  - consider the various tools at your disposal, what we've learned so far
  - break a big problem into more manageable chunks
  - write each step you'll take to solve the problem in comments, then fill in the code below the comment
- When you get an error:
  - read the error message carefully
  - look at where in the code it points to
  - google the error message if it's specific
- When you get stuck:
  - take a step back, re-evaluate the problem context
  - watch Canvas recordings, review #assignments-announcements, #coding-tasks, w3schools
  - look for similar examples on stack overflow
  - try extracting bits of code and running them in isolation
  - ask a teammate, TA, or instructor
- Avoid getting burnt-out:
  - take regular breaks
  - test as you develop code to ensure you're on the write path, don't get stuck in the trap of writing a lot of code and trying to tweak the syntax


## Exercises

### Lectures & Demonstrations

The purpose of lectures is to introduce and explain a topic. Most lectures are followed by live demonstrations. Please do not distract yourself during lecture. These will be recorded and posted after class.

### Labs

Labs represent the bulk of the course work. Read the requirement, plan out a solution, and implement your solution in a `.java` file. Please label your solutions very clearly (`day01.java`, `day02.java`).

These assignments are designed to build upon each other, and so are best completed in order. The purpose of these is to practice your ability to break down a problem and express solutions in code.

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after 15 minutes of review and research, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input. 


### Student Presentations

Weekly, a different student presents a topic. 

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

## Code of Conduct

At RenasTech we seek to create an environment conducive to personal and professional growth. 

- Respect the rights of all others. Foster a safe and comfortable social environment. Show respect for every member of our community, including members of partnering communities without regard to sex, age, race, color, ethnic origins, sexual orientation, economic status, gender expression, size, physical ability, learning styles, nationality, religion, or thought.
- Treat one another in a professional manner at all times. Harassment, intimidation, humiliation, excluding or acts of bullying will not be tolerated. If you witness such acts, report them immediately to a school official.
- Refrain from disruptive behavior in the classroom, on the RenasTech premises, and at any RenasTech hosted event.
- Engage in conduct appropriate for an educational and professional setting, refraining from behavior that may shock or disturb others.
- Refrain from using offensive or abusive language.
- Demonstrate dignity and integrity in all aspects of involvement with RenasTech, including participation in sponsored events, and situations in which we may be seen to represent RenasTech. These activities and situations include, but are not limited to events hosted by RenasTech, events in the greater technology community, conferences and meetings, and your interactions with our partners and with potential employers.

## Academic Progress

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works. 

## Attendance

Students are expected to be on time and attend all scheduled class times. The school requires ninety percent (90%) completion of class hours in order to receive a certificate of completion from the course. Students can miss no more than 7 days for the day class and 9 days for the evening class. Students can also not be absent for more than 5 days consecutively (this includes weekends).

Any Student arriving more than 15 minutes late for scheduled class time will be marked tardy. Tardiness without legitimate reason on three different occasions will be counted as one absence.

A studentâ€™s account is reviewed after 5 days from payment due date.  Accounts that remain unpaid or have not established a Repayment Agreement through our billing cycle will be issued a Final Notice.  Upon Final Notice students will be revoked from classes and no refunds will be issued.  Failure to maintain payments under the Repayment Agreement will result in an account being sent to collections.
